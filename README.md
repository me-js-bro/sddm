## Install
### From sources
> _Assumes that you've installed and configured SDDM correctly_ (if not [read more](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SDDM))

>  Please make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
>  `qt5-quickcontrols2`, `qt5-graphicaleffects`, `qt5-svg` 

1. Open terminal, and clone the repository with:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JaKooLit/simple-sddm.git ~/simple-sddm
   ```

2. Then move it as follows:

   ```bash
   sudo mv ~/simple-sddm /usr/share/sddm/themes/
   ```

## Configure

Edit the `/etc/sddm.conf.d/10-theme.conf` (with any text editor with **raised** privileges), so that it looks like this:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sddm.conf.d/10-theme.conf  # use any text editor with raised privileges
---

[Theme]

   ```

### Language and time format
- By default, it is configured with 24H format. You can change to AM/PM variant by editing the theme.conf
```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/sddm/themes/simple-sddm/theme.conf  # use any text editor with raised privileges
```
- `HourFormat="hh:mm AP` . Make sure to disable the above of this part
- To change the default wallpaper put desired image in the `simple-sddm/Backgrounds/` folder and add the name of the image followed by its extension (`.jpg` or `.png`) in `theme.conf` file.
- You can also customize it further if you wish in the `theme.conf`
